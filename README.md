# Schrodinger_Numerical
Examples of Numerical Solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for simple potentials as finite difference boundary value problem.
This illustrates how the differential equation problem is transformed into a linear algebra problem.
Also provides a simple way to obtain energy levels and their wave functions for single particle quantum problems
