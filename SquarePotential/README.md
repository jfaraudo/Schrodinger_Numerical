Examples numerical solution of Schr√∂dinger equation for a variety of cases with a square potential.

The examples include:
- Particle in a box (infinite potential barriers at the limits of a finite box). The analytical result is available in any QM textbook, for example [here in Chemistry Libretext](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Grinnell_College/CHM_364%3A_Physical_Chemistry_2_(Grinnell_College)/03%3A_The_Schrodinger_Equation_and_a_Particle_in_a_Box/3.05%3A_The_Energy_of_a_Particle_in_a_Box_is_Quantized)

- Particle in a square potential with the same values taken here in this [Chemistry Libretext](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Quantum_Tutorials_(Rioux)/09%3A_Numerical_Solutions_for_Schrodinger's_Equation/9.05%3A_Particle_in_a_Finite_Potential_Well) example.
