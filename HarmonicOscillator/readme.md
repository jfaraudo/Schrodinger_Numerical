Numerical Solution 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

Method: discretization of differential equation which leads to a matrix diagonalization.

Units: Dimensionless units, Energy in units of h_bar omega_0 and coordinates in units of sqrt(m omega_0/h_bar)
(h_bar = Reduced Planck constant, m = mass of oscillator and omega_0 = frequency of oscillator )
