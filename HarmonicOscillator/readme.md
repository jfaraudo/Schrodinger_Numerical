# Numerical Solution 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

The example in Colab considers the same parameters as in Chemistry [LibreText](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Quantum_Tutorials_(Rioux)/09%3A_Numerical_Solutions_for_Schrodinger's_Equation/9.09%3A_Numerical_Solutions_for_the_Harmonic_Oscillator)

The python scripts implement two different choices of units:
- Atomic units (as in the COlab exmaple)
- Dimensionless units (as in the pdf document in the main folder) in which one considers Energy in units of h_bar omega_0 and coordinates in units of sqrt(m omega_0/h_bar)
(h_bar = Reduced Planck constant, m = mass of oscillator and omega_0 = frequency of oscillator )
